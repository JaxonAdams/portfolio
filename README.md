## Description
This portfolio was built using React. It includes sections for my bio, projects, contact info, and my resume. After you make it to the landing page, use the menu button in the top right to open the navbar and navigate the site. This is a single-page application (SPA), so while it may look like you are visiting different pages, it is all the same webpage! 

Visit the site at the following link: 
 - [My Portfolio](https://jaxonadams.github.io/portfolio)
    


## Usage
Please note, currently the form in 'Contact Me' does nothing with the information submitted. I will soon update the site to send the info somewhere I can see it, but as of now the site has no back end. If you wish to contact me, text or email me using the information provided on the same page.
